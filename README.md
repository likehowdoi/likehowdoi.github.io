with your actual github user name.
3. Name the repository username.github.io
4. Clone it to your development workstation, add an index.html file.
	echo "Hello World" > index.html;
	git add index.html
	git commit -m 'First Commit'
	git push origin master
5. Visit http://username.github.io in your browser.

```
github.com user bob creates a new repository named "bob.github.io" and 
adds 
an index.html file, commits and pushes the changes to github, and visits 
the new page created at http://bob.github.io
```

This repository was created with this exact technique, and is updated by 
pushing new commits to github.
